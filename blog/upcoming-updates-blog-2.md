# Upcoming Updates \(Blog \#2\)

Today we announce new updates on the horizon. I know, we haven't been updating Izen as frequently as some may like, but we were handling a huge outage with our bots host and had to clear up some files. We are close to releasing V 2.1.2. We are hoping to release 2.2.0 in about a month. Also, our GitHub hasn't been update-to-date with everything, so we'll fix that in later releases. Thank you for supporting us in Discord and we hope to see you at a later time.
